    <h2>Backdoor-Remover Tool</h2>

    <p>Introducing the backdoor-remover tool</p>
    
    <p>The amazing tool responsible for removing backdoors on almost any piece of software.</p>

    <p>
    The tool allows you to clean any software 
    <a href="https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/ghidra" class="urltext">
        you know its backdoored
    </a>
     to make a perfectly clean build out of it.
    </p>

    <button class="big-rounded-button" data-link="about/">
        Get backdor-remover
    </button>


    <p>
    The Backdoor-Remover works by going through the entirety of the project, scanning for backdoors and 
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/?title=Remote_access_trojan" class="urltext"> R.A.T.s</a>
    (Remote Access Trojans),
    and other malware
    (such as 
    <a href="about/rust.html" class="urltext">the rust programming language</a>
    and 
    <a href="about/wayland.html" class="urltext">the wayland display protocol</a>
    ) and removes them from the project.
    </p>
    <p>
    Its 98.9% flawless with minimal manual file patching, requiring only a low ammount of human supervision to
    clean
    entire projects in a couple minutes.
    </p>

    <h3>How does it work?</h3>

    <p>
    Backdoor-Remover tool works by using a cabela core as its main processing unit.
    This allows it to use 100% of its processing power to clean the build.
    </p>

    <p>
    Auto Clean build macro, this allows the tool to use any build sytem / tooling the project uses to rebuild 
    a clean version of the project.
    </p>

    <p>The Reverse-backdoor-tech allows you to backdoor the backdoor, basically owning the feds who
    put the backdoor there in the first place.
    </p>

    <p>The RAT persistance remover module allows the tool to check for rat persistances on the project it is cleaning.
    It checks for places such as /usr/bin or if the RAT installed itself on the computer BIOS, and deletes it.
    </p>

    <p>Then it checks and removes any NSA backdoors with a bypass. This might come as a shock to you 
    but you can bypass NSA or any other governament-sponsored backdoor attempts, the tool automates that.</p>
    <p>The Bypass consists of using military-weapons-grade uranium to burn the bytes off the project.</p>

    <p>Then it uses all of its combined power to automatically rewrite any malicious files, ensuring
    100% of the functionality is kept.</p>

    <h4>All of that with the ensured quality via the Cabela seal of approval.</h4>
